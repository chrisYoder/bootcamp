CSS colors:
    - built in colors are not particularly nice
        -not used often
        
    -hexadecimal
        -format: #_ _ _ _ _ _ 
        -first two = amount of red
        -middle two = amount of green
        -last two = amount of blue
        -#000000 = black
        -#FFFFFF = white
        
    -rgba 
        -format rgba(amt of red, amt of green, amt of blue, alpha)
            -3 color channels
                -0-255 with all 0's being black and all 255 being white
            -alpha is the opacity of the elements   
                -0 to 1 with one being fully visible and zero being invisible
                -I will demonstrate on the li's
                
                
CSS Selectors that I must memorize
https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048

    -elements--> li{}
    -classes--> .classname{}
    -id--> #idName{}
    -Star--> *{} --> selects everything
    -descendent--> parent descendent{} --> selects all the elements that are descendents of the parent
    -adjacent--> sibling + sibling {} --> allows us to select elements that on the same nesting level
    -attribute--> elem[attr] {}--> allows us to select all elements with a specific attribute 
        -input[type='inputType']{ style }
        -a[href="link"] { style ]
    -nth of type--> element:nth-of-type(num) -->allows us to select the nth number of a parent element
    
CSS Inheritance and Specificity
    -Inheritance: an element will automatically inherit the styling of a parent element. 
    
    -specificity: the more specific a selector is (li v body) then that is the style that will be applied.
        -specificity order: element, element+psuedoclass, class, class+psuedoclass, id, id+psuedoclass
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity
        
    -so if body{color: red;} and ul{color: blue} then the li elements will be blue because the ul selector is more specific than the body selector and it will inherit the styling from the ul selector.
