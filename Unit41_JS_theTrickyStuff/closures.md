# Closures

#### Objectives
* Understand what a closure is and what it is not
* Use a closure to emulate private variables
* List Use cases for closures in the real world

#### Definition
* A clusure is a function that makes use of variables defined in outer functions that have previously returned

#### Couple of things to note
* we have to return the inner function 
* we can either call the inner function using ()() or we can store the result of the function in a variable (similar to bind). 
* we do not have to give the inner function a name.

#### Use Cases
* private variables
